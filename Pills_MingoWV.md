The most prominent pharmacies that participated in the sale of opioids in Mingo, West Virginia are shown in the left upper table. Pharmacies like <mark>Strosnider</mark>, Hurley Drug Company and Tug Valley Pharmacy were being delivered over 8 million doses each over 6 years. <br>

Taking the case of <mark>Strosnider</mark> is intriguing: it was delivered 13.1 million doses, this is, 1.9 million doses per year. What makes it even more interesting is that the people those pharmacies serve, calculated by the population residing in an area of 5 miles around the business locations amount to 9,361 people (upper right table).<br>
<b>Assuming</b> that these pharmacies were selling all the doses they recevied, and that they were only serving population within 5 miles, this means that every year, each of the 9,361 inhabitants bought a bit more than 202 doses of opioids. Hard to believe. Rather, it is highly probable that these pharmacies where selling painkillers to a wider list of customers, who were perhaps traveling from distant places to get their prescriptions filled. <br>
