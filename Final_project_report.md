<h1> Final project </h1>

<h1> Section 1. Descriptive analytics </h1>
<!-- What is the overall trend in sales over the past years?<br>
Are there any patterns?<br> -->


Alcohol sales and consumption are two components of Iowa's social and economic landscape. Not only does Iowa produces corn for industrial ethanol (4.5 billion gallons in 2022, contributing with over 25% to total U.S. ethanol production of ~17.5 billion gallons). But it is also home to many breweries, distilleries and wineries that produce alcohol for human consumption. This analysis focuses on the latter, but does not include beer and wine.<br>
<br>
In Iowa, people spent around 771 million dollars per year in alcoholic beverages last year, this is, approximately 593.3 dollars per household. Iowa is the 37th state in terms of spending on alcoholic beverages.<br> 
<br>
On the tax side of this story (there is always a tax side), Iowa's state and local tax revenues from alcohol generated -in 2022- "an all-time record of $150.1 million, an increase of $284,106 over the previous fiscal year. The sales growth generated record liquor net profits of $120.6 million, which will be used to support essential state programs and services.", according to the Alcoholic Beverages Division. However, when compared to the rest of the country, Iowa ranks 5 places lower than in consumption, in 42th place.<br>

<br>

Over time, although total alcohol sales (in USD) show a substantial increasing trend, if we look at sales over time in liters, then the upward trend is not so evident. A potential explanation for this mismatch could be inflationary: as prices continue to go up, the total ticket for the same amount of alcohol goes up. Data then shows a modest increase in alcohol consumption in the state.

<br>
<br>

When looking into the categories of alcohol that Iowans prefer, the top 2 products sold are domestic vodka and domestic whisky, wth combined sales of over 56 million dollars.

Focusing on sales of alcohol over the state of Iowa, the follwowing raph shows that yearly sales follow a normal seasonal pattern, with annual increases in sales during June and December. Perhps this pattern is better shown in the clock date graph that contains the volume of alcohol sold each month in Iowa during the past 5.5 years by month (there is no data for july-Dec 2022):
<br>
<br>

If analyzed by county, volume sold concentrates in urban areas, specifically in counties with cities. Des Moines in Polk county, Cedar rapids in Linn county, Waterloo, Davenport and Iowa City in Black Hawk county, Scott county and Johnson county, accordingly. While there are adjustments to be made to some of the variable -and that are adressed in the analysis that follows-, the graphs and maps shown provide a good idea of what, when, how much and where do Iowans consume alcohol.

<h1> Section 2. Geo spatial descriptive analysis </h1>
<!-- Which stores have the highest and lowest sales?
Is there a geographical pattern in the data?
Are there any clusters or hotspots of high/low sales?
What factors are contributing to these hot/cold spots? -->
<!-- Is there any relationship with CDCâ€™s Alcohol dependency data?
Is there any relationship with other health metrics? -->

A first approach to the spatial relationship between alcohol consumption and its effect on health-related variables is shown in the following two maps. Both include a kernel density of the volume of sales in liters. The fisrt map has an underlying choropleth layer with the rate of excess drinking in each county, while the second shows in blue the number of deaths in driving accidents related to alcohol impared driving as a percentage of total deaths in driving accidents. Interestingly enough, some counties with a somewhat high concetration of alcohol sales do not register much excessive drinking (such as Cass and Shelby in the Southwest, or Ottumba and Farifield in the Southeast). 
<br>
Some similar cases appear also in the case of deaths related to impaired driving, in counties such as Waterloo. I think a partial conclusion from this maps could be that we see an expected relationship in most of the cases, but some counties do not exhibit such patterns.
<br>

<br>


Next, arcGIS was used to create a more refined analysis. For starters, the variable consumption over population was created. This variable takes the amount of liters sold and divides it by the number of people over 21 years old, who live in an area of 4 miles around the store. This data is available for every store selling alcohol in Iowa.
<br>

The next graph shows that the average consumption of alcohol lies around 1.6-1.7 liters per month, and appears to have a pretty stable pattern over the last six years.

This is how this variable looks like: on average, 

<br>

There is some trend in the consumption of alcohol. The middle and the end of the year usually have higher rates of consumption.
<br>



Another piece of information related to alcohol consumption has to do with health indicators. Spcieficially, with CDC's excess drinking (defined as...) and fatalities caused by driving accidents due to alcohol impairement. In this regard, it is a bit surprising to note that....
