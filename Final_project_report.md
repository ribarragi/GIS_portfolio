# Final project


I wanted to create a story map, but after several attemps, I could not load scenes into my ArcGIS online account.

The main overall objective of this project was to explore and <b>EXPLOT?</b> the funcitonalities of time cubes for temporal data in ArcGIS

# Section 1. Descriptive analytics
What is the overall trend in sales over the past years?
Are there any patterns?

# Section2. Geo spatial descriptive analysis
Which stores have the highest and lowest sales?
Is there a geographical pattern in the data?
Are there any clusters or hotspots of high/low sales?
What factors are contributing to these hot/cold spots?

# Section 3. Relationship with health indicators
Is there any relationship with CDC’s Alcohol dependency data?
Is there any relationship with other health metrics?

# Section 4. Predict future sales
Is it possible to predict future sales of alcohol using ?
What factors should we consider to predict it?
What factors turn out to be the most relevant for the predictions?



## Section 1. Descriptive analytics
Alcohol sales in Iowa ...
he data consists of ...


Alcohol sales and consumption are aspects of Iowa's social and economic landscape. The state's breweries, wineries, and distilleries have been a part of Iowa's culture for centuries, contributing to the state's tourism and economic growth. However, the consumption of alcohol also poses significant public health concerns, with excessive drinking and alcohol-related accidents being prevalent issues in Iowa. Understanding the impact of alcohol sales and consumption on Iowa's economy, society, and public health is crucial in addressing these concerns.

Alcohol sales and consumption have long been a part of American culture, and Iowa is no exception. The state is known for its breweries and wineries, and the alcohol industry plays a significant role in the state's economy. According to the Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division, Iowa's liquor industry generated $334 million in revenue in the 2021 fiscal year. This revenue is distributed among the state's various stakeholders, including the government, wholesalers, and retailers.

However, the prevalence of alcohol consumption also poses significant public health risks. Iowa has a history of high rates of excessive drinking and alcohol-related deaths, particularly in car accidents. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, excessive drinking accounts for over 1,100 deaths per year in Iowa, and impaired driving accounts for 26% of all traffic fatalities in the state. These statistics illustrate the importance of understanding the impact of alcohol sales and consumption on public health and safety in Iowa.

The Alcoholic Beverages Division (ABD) generated a significant return on investment to the citizens of Iowa in fiscal year 2022. The amount of sales and revenue generated to the State General Fund was an all-time record of $150.1 million, an increase of $284,106 over the previous fiscal year. The sales growth generated record liquor net profits of $120.6 million, which will be used to support essential state programs and services.
