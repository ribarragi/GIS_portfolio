<h1> Final project </h1>

<h1> Section 1. Descriptive analytics </h1>
What is the overall trend in sales over the past years?
Are there any patterns?


Alcohol sales and consumption are two components of Iowa's social and economic landscape. Not only does Iowa produces corn for industrial ethanol (4.5 billion gallons in 2022, contributing with over 25% to total U.S. ethanol production of ~17.5 billion gallons). But it is also home to many breweries, distilleries and wineries.

In Iowa, people spend some 771 million dollars per year in alcoholic beverages, this is around 593.3 dollars per household per year. Iowa is the 37th state in terms of spending on alcohol for human consumption. 

Another part of this story is Iowa's state and local tax revenues that come from alcohol. According to the Alcoholic Beverages Division, this industry generated in 2022  "an all-time record of $150.1 million, an increase of $284,106 over the previous fiscal year. The sales growth generated record liquor net profits of $120.6 million, which will be used to support essential state programs and services." However, when compared to the rest of the country, Iowa ranks 42th.

<h1>DISCLAIMERS</h1>
I wanted to create a story map, but after several attemps, I could not load scenes into my ArcGIS online account.

The main overall objective of this project was to explore and <b>EXPLOT?</b> the funcitonalities of time cubes for temporal data in ArcGIS
