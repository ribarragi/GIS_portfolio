# GIS Portfolio
Welcome! This is my portfolio for Advanced GIS class


## About me
I’m Ricardo Ibarra-Gil, currently a Graduate student of Masters in Public Policy and Managemenet - Data Analytics at Carnegie Mellon University. My interests include the use of data to analyze consumer behavior.  

## What I hope to learn
I hope to learn on how to use GIS collaboratively: creating, editing and mantaining data in a team. 

I am also interested in diving deeper into data science with GIS. Last year, a big surprise to me was the wide range of data science applications out there, so I am interested in exploring it further.

Additionally, one of the aspects that I like less about GIS its click-intensive nature, so I am interersted in learning how to integrate GIS with Python, to make it more programming-like.
