The heatmap shows a concentration of collisions involving cyclists mainly in downtown Ottawa.The image below shows that intersections along Laurier Avenue are prone to collisions involving cyclists. The fact that this is close to the Univeristy of Ottawa may be a factor explaining the high rate of collisions, as students may be using their bikes to get to school.
